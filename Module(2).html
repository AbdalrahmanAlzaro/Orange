    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Full Stack Developer from Zarqa, Jordan. I love building web
      applications that solve real problems for real users. I have over 2.5
      years of professional experience and I'm currently finishing my Computer
      Information Systems degree.

    <!-- Introduction with bold name -->
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Abd al-Rahman Al Zaro</strong> and I am a passionate
      web developer who enjoys turning ideas into working products.
    </p>

    <!-- Hobby emphasized with em -->
    <p>
      Outside of work, I have a deep interest in <em>programming challenges</em>
      — there is nothing quite like the satisfaction of solving a hard problem
      with clean, elegant code.

    <!-- Favorite quote highlighted with mark -->
    <p>
      A quote I keep coming back to:
      <mark>"The best way to predict the future is to create it."</mark>
    </p>

    <!-- Chemical formula using sub, math equation using sup -->
    <p>
      A classic chemistry example: water is written as H<sub>2</sub>O, and
      carbon dioxide as CO<sub>2</sub>. In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem
      is expressed as a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>

    <!-- del and ins showing something I changed about myself -->
    <p>
      Earlier this year my daily routine was:
      <del>wake up late and skip breakfast</del>. I changed that to:
      <ins>wake up early, pray Fajr, and eat a proper meal</ins>. Small habits,
      big difference.

        A developer's haiku
        ───────────────────

        Code compiles clean —
        the bug that haunted all week
        was a missing semicolon.
